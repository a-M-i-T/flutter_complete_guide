// This is a basic Flutter widget test.
//
// To perform an interaction with a widget in your test, use the WidgetTester
// utility that Flutter provides. For example, you can send tap and scroll
// gestures. You can also use WidgetTester to find child widgets in the widget
// tree, read text, and verify that the values of widget properties are correct.

// import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

// import 'package:flutter_complete_guide/main.dart';

void main() {
  // Define a test. The TestWidgets function also provides a WidgetTester
  // to work with. The WidgetTester allows you to build and interact
  // with widgets in the test environment.
  testWidgets('MyWidget has a title and message', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Test code goes here.
  });
